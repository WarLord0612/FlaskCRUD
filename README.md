Hey!This is a basic CRUD application I created that uses flask and mongoDB.

This is a sample project that is used to create,retrieve,update and delete users(documents) from the "users" collection in the "company" database.

If you're a beginner,you should install mongo compass for an effective sight of the operations on the database and use this project.
